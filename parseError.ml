   This module demonstrates that we can easily generate contextual
   error message thanks to the introspection API. Indeed, when a
   parsing error occurs, there exist items in the stack whose analysis
   is not completed. Therefore, the non terminals of their productions
   are probably the syntactically classes that are being recognized
   when the error occurred.
